# REPORT

## 📚 Project Overview

Augmented Reality lenses superimpose **interactive digital content** onto the real world, unlike Virtual Reality, which creates isolated experiences.  
AR lenses offer **hands-free, immersive, real-time interactions** with surroundings — transforming industries like **healthcare, education, retail, gaming, and industrial work**.

**Leading companies** (Apple, Google, Microsoft) have already shown early prototypes. Our project goes a step further by addressing **control systems, data processing, energy harvesting**, and **intuitive eye-based interactions**.

---

## ✨ Key Contributions

- Ultra-thin **Micro-LED/OLED displays** integrated into flexible, biocompatible lenses.
- **Eye tracking & blink recognition** for seamless control without external devices.
- **Energy harvesting** and **microbatteries** for long-term wear without bulky systems.
- **Edge AI processing** for real-time AR rendering and decision-making.
- **Wireless communication** via **BLE** and **NFC** for smooth device interaction.
- Full system integration combining **display, control, and AI** — not just isolated features.
